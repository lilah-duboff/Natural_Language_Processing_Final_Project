### Project Purpose and Summary
Using a dataset of patents submitted to the U.S. Patent Office(USPTO) by subsidiaries of large multinational corporations, performed clustering of patents into patent topic categories. Some of the NLP techniques employed in this assignment included performing data cleaning on patent text, embedding generation for clustering in a high-dimensional space, dimension reduction using PCA/UMAP and machine learning algorithms(HDBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Naive Bayes) for clustering patent abstracts and titles into a set of relevant comparable topics. 

The motivation behind this work is to address the task of tracking innovation across publicly traded companies, especially where patents are filed under different subsidiary names(i.e. “Google” with patents under “Waymo”, “DeepMind”, “Nest”); Emerging technological advancements often occur under subsidiaries of large corporations, but are not tracked due to the multitude of subsidiary firms. This project explores classification methods beyond the traditional Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) system, offering more flexible and insightful ways for legal specialists, researchers, and investors to explore patent content and similar innovation strategies.
